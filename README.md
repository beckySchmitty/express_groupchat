# GroupChat - Websocket Practice

GroupChat is an Express-based app that uses websocks for a live, multi-room chat system. 

Springboard provided working code for me to explore and I added the ability for a user to type "/joke" or "/members" in the chat message form and then have the specific response (jokes or member list) appear in only their group chat. This was the exercise at the end of our Express unit and first websocket intro.
